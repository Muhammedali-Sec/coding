                <h3>Getting Started with GitHub Pages</h3>
                <p class="blog-date">November 20, 2025</p>
                <p>
                    GitHub Pages is an amazing free hosting service that allows you to publish 
                    websites directly from your GitHub repository. The process is surprisingly simple. 
                    After creating a repository, you just need to enable GitHub Pages in the settings, 
                    and your site goes live within minutes.

                <h3>My Journey Learning Web Development</h3>
                <p class="blog-date">November 15, 2025</p>
                <p>
                    When I first started learning web development, HTML and CSS seemed daunting. 
                    But with consistent practice and the right resources, I've made significant progress. 
                    The key is to start small and build projects. Each small project teaches you 
                    something new and builds your confidence.

                <p class="blog-date">November 10, 2025</p>
                <p>
                    In today's world, people browse websites on phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops. 
                    Responsive design ensures your website looks great and functions properly on all 
                    these devices. Using media queries and flexible grids, you can create websites 
                    that adapt seamlessly to any screen size.

                    As a beginner web developer, having the right tools can significantly boost your 
                    productivity and learning speed. Here are my must-have tools that I use daily: 
                    VS Code for coding, Chrome DevTools for debugging, and Git for version control. 
                    Each of these tools has made my development process smoother and more efficient.

                <h3>Building My First Portfolio Website</h3>
                <p class="blog-date">October 28, 2025</p>
                <p>
                    Creating a portfolio website was one of my first major web development projects. 
                    It was challenging, exciting, and incredibly rewarding. I learned so much about 
                    HTML structure, CSS styling, responsive design, and hosting. This experience taught 
                    me the importance of planning and testing across different devices.

                <h3>Why I Chose Web Development</h3>
                <p class="blog-date">October 20, 2025</p>
                <p>
                    Everyone has their own story of how they got into programming. For me, it started 
                    with curiosity about how websites work. The ability to create something visible 
                    and interactive that people around the world can use fascinated me. Web development 
                    combines creativity with logic, design with functionality.
